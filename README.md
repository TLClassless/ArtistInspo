### ðŸ’¡ The Concept
You know those moments when you know there's something you wanna draw, or paint, or... *Digital*... *Art(?)* but you don't have any **iN**sporation? Well, that's what I made **iNspo** for! (not sure I'll keep the camelcase, its a process.)

iNspo is an app designed to give you an art prompt, some inspirational images, and (soon) the option to submit your own iNspos to inspire others, and maybe even your future self!

### ðŸ“± The App

The app is being made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and Vanilla JS (Tried using [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) for some bits, but eventually decided against it to keep the app light) - The current distribution plan is to make it a PWA.
